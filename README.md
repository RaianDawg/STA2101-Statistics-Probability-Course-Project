# Global Terrorism Statistical Analysis (1970–2017)

## Project Overview
This repository contains my course project for **STA 2101: Statistics & Probability** at the **University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB)**. The project applies fundamental statistical and probability concepts to the **Global Terrorism Database (GTD)** in order to examine patterns in terrorist incidents and their human impact.

The analysis focuses on how attacks occur, how severe they are, and how different characteristics relate to casualties. The project emphasizes statistical reasoning and interpretation rather than prediction.

## Dataset
**Global Terrorism Database (GTD)**  
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd  

The dataset records terrorist incidents worldwide from 1970 to 2017. Each row represents a single incident and includes information on attack type, target, success, and outcomes such as fatalities (`nkill`) and injuries (`nwound`).

## Methodology & Analysis
The project is completed across multiple milestones, each aligned with topics covered in the course:

- **Sampling Methods:**  
  Simple random, systematic, stratified, and cluster sampling applied to a large real-world dataset.

- **Descriptive Statistics:**  
  Frequency distributions, histograms, frequency polygons, and ogives used to summarize key numerical variables.

- **Central Tendency & Dispersion:**  
  Analysis of mean, median, variance, and standard deviation to understand data spread and skewness.

- **Probability Analysis:**  
  Empirical probability calculations using real-world event definitions, including intersections, unions, complements, and conditional probabilities.

- **Bayesian Reasoning & Distribution Analysis:**  
  Application of Bayes’ rule and normal distribution concepts to casualty-related variables.

- **Simple Linear Regression:**  
  Manual least-squares regression used to explore relationships between fatalities and other numerical variables, with a focus on exploratory trends rather than causal claims.
